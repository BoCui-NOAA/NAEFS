NAEFS minor implementation 

- Variable ULWRF is accumulated value since the beginning in CMC raw ensemble. One
  task of job JNAEFS_CMC_ENS_POST is to convert it to 6-hour or 3-hour average.
  The date range of average value are different from the accumulation. Modification 
  is needed get proper date compression setting. 

The modified source codes include:
