NAEFS v7.0.0 Implementation Instructions:

1. Checkout NAEFS repository

 https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NAEFS/tree/develop                        

2.  copy fix directory from naefs v6.1.5
    fix files are available at: /lfs/h1/ops/prod/packages/naefs.v6.1.5/fix                  

3. Set up the package

   copy this directory to your file location

  (2) Build the executables of NAEFS
      Go to the sorc sub-directory, following the instructions in README.build file,
      all the executables will be generated and saved in the exec sub-directory.

4. Start the test run
   Check and modify (if it is necessary) job cards in sub-directory ecf
  
5. Resources requirements

  (1) Compute resource information:
      Computer: currently needs about 25 nodes (peak), no change in total nodes, but changed ncpus and mpiprocs settings
      Please check the ecf directory, the computer resource requirement
      can be found in each jobs' ecf file

  (2) Disk space

      NCEP GEFS ensmeble:

      Main changes happen for directories with 10 more ensemble members,
      disk space changes from 649GB to 848G per day 
      - pgrb2ap5_bc:   40GB per cycle, 0.5d bias corrected forecasts (3 hourly for day 8)
      - pgrb2ap5_an:   17GB per cycle, 0.5d anomaly forecast
      - pgrb2ap5_wt:   13MB per cycle, 0.5d weight for each member
      - prcp_bc_gb2:   611MB per cycle, 6-hour and 24-hour APCP 
      - ndgd_prcp_gb2: 2.3GB per cycle, 6-hour and 24-hour APCP 
      - gempak:        448GB for 30 members

      FNMOC ensmeble:

      Main changes happen for new directories pgrb2ap5 pgrb2ap5_bc, pgrb2ap5_an, pgrb2ap5_w,
      disk space changes from 25GB to 142G per day
      - new pgrb2ap5   : 2.1GB per cycle, 0.5d ensemble forecasts (3 hourly for day 8)
      - new pgrb2ap5_bc: 1.4GB per cycle, 0.5d bias corrected forecasts (3 hourly for day 8)
      - new pgrb2ap5_an: 8.8GB per cycle, 0.5d anomaly forecast
      - new pgrb2ap5_wt: 8.2MB per cycle, 0.5d weight for each member
      - gempak:          117GB, 0.5d bias corrected forecasts
