NAEFS minor implementation 


- The CMC ensemble has a model upgrade on Sep. 18, 2018, which has higher resolution
  than before. This means the highest mountains go slightly higher in the atmosphere. 
  Therefore some points in the CMC forecast data have a value of relative humidity 
  equal to exactly 0. This caused problems in NCEP post-process system when calculating
  dew point temperature with CMC RH2m and T2m input. The 0 RH2m value causes unrealistic
  dew point temperature. Modifications in post-process codes are needed handle with
  these extreme cases.

The modified source codes include:

NAEFS Jobs

1. jobs/JNAEFS_PROB_AVGSPR  

 1) sorc/naefs_probability.fd/naefs_bc_probability.f90
   - modified, add protection for extreme cases with 0 relative humidity

2. jobs/JNAEFS_GEFS_BIAS         
 1) sorc/gefs_bias.fd/gefs_bias.f90                
   - modified, add protection for extreme cases with 0 relative humidity

Implementation instruction

Two source codes are modified for this minor implementation. All the others are kept the
same as the NAEFS package in /nwprod/naefs.v6.0.4.

Keep use /nwprod/naefs.v6.0.4/ush/naefs_bc_probability.sh
(roll back the change on naefs.v6.0.5 for this ush script)
